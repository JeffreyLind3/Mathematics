\section{Introduction}
When a quantifier is used on the variable \(x\), we say that this occurrence of the variable is \textbf{bound}. An occurrence of a variable that is not bound by a quantifier or set equal to a particular value is said to be \textbf{free}. All the variables that occur in a propositional function must be bound or set equal to a particular value to turn it into a proposition. This can be done using a combination of universal quantifiers, existential quantifiers, and value assignments.

The part of a logical expression to which a quantifier is applied is called the \textbf{scope} of this quantifier. Consequently, a variable is free if it is outside the scope of all quantifiers in the formula that specify this variable.

\begin{example}
    In the statement \(\exists x (x + y = 1)\), the variable \(x\) is bound by the existential quantification \(\exists x\), but the variable \(y\) is free because it is not bound by a quantifier and no value is assigned to this variable. This illustrates that in the statement \(\exists x (x + y = 1)\), \(x\) is bound, but \(y\) is free.

    In the statement \(\exists x (P(x) \land Q(x)) \lor \forall x R(x)\), all variables are bound. The scope of the first quantifier, \(\exists x\), is the expression \(P(x) \land Q(x)\)
\end{example}
